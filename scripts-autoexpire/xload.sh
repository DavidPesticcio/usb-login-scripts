Usage: $0 [<hours_to_keep_key>] [keep]

  Temporarily installs the SSH key from the disk drive then optionally
  unmounts the drive.

Parameters:

  hours_to_keep_key     Integer number of hours to keep key installed
                        (defaults to loading key until 6:20pm local time)
  keep                  If specified, will not try to unmount the volume
                        (unmounting is only attempted if the path begins
                        with /Volumes/)
